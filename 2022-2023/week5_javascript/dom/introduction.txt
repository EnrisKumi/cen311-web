What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is the data representation of the objects that
comprise the structure and content of a document on the web
Through DOM, programs can change the document structure, style and content.

The DOM is not part of JS but a Web API
The DOM is independent of any programming language (we will only use it through JS)

Fundamental data types (interfaces)

1) Document
The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point
into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.
2) Node
Every object located within a document is a node of some kind
(element node, text node, attribute node)
3) Element
The element type is based on node. It refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API
4) NodeList
A nodeList is an array of elements
5) Attr
Attributes are nodes in the DOM just like elements are
