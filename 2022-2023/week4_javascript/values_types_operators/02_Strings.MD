Single quotes ('Hello'), double quotes ("Hello"), or backticks (`Hello`)
Based on Unicode standard, JavaScript’s representation uses 16 bits per string element

Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but the + operator concatenates two strings

Template literals or string interpolation `half of 100 is ${100 / 2}` produces “half of 100 is 50”.
