JavaScript uses 64 bits to store numbers (integer and floating-point numbers)
You may also use scientific notation 2.998e8
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3

When operators appear together without parentheses, the order in which
they are applied is determined by the precedence of the operators
When multiple operators with the same precedence appear next to each other,
associativity is applied (left-to-right)

Special numbers: Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN
